# Un{i}packer
## Unpacking PE files via emulation

The usage of runtime packers by malware authors is very common, as it is a technique that helps to hinder analysis.
Furthermore, packers are a challenge for antivirus products, as they make it impossible to identify malware by signatures
or hashes alone.

In order to be able to analyze a packed malware sample, it is often required to unpack the binary. Usually this means,
that the analyst will have to manually unpack the binary by using dynamic analysis techniques (Tools: OllyDbg, x64Dbg).
There are also some approaches for automatic unpacking, but they are all only available for Windows. Therefore when
targeting a packed Windows malware the analyst will require a Windows machine. The goal of our project is to enable
platform independent automatic unpacking by using emulation.
